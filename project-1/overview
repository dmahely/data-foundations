# Working with Data

In the first project in the Data Foundations Nanodegree, you need to choose between three Tableau visulizations and find insights about that visualization. 
The end result should be a pdf report that includes three insights and screenshots that show how you got them. I chose the Malaria in Africa storyboard.
