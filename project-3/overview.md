# Query a Digital Music Store Database

In the third project in the Data Foundations Nanodegree, you are given a music database and asked to use SQL to write queries to answer questions and find insights. 
You are expected to come up with the questions yourself. The end product should be the SQL queries and a report showing your insights and visualizations to support them.
