# Data Foundations Nanodegree

This repository contains all the projects I have done in order to complete the Data Foundations Nanodegree offered by Udacity.
The nanodegree has four main parts: statistics, spreadsheets, SQL and data visualizations. 


The projects include:
1. Interpreting Tableau storyboards to find insights
2. Analyzing survey data using spreadsheet software
3. Analyzing databases using SQL
4. Building a storyboard using Tableau

_P.S.: If you're still going through the Nanodegree, feel free to take a look at the projects for inspiration, just don't copy stuff outright._
